# hospital-manager

### This is the backend skeleton of a hospital management app , I have used Nodejs , expressjs , mongodb .
### I have created 3 apis , one for the doctors , one for the drugs and one for the patients 
### I have followed RESTful architecture in constructing the Apis where they perform the essential CRUD operations
